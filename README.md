FRACTAL EXTRUDER
Lsystem generator for blender 2.9+

I wrote this addon to experiment with Lsystem grammar inside blender.
The code needs an heavy refactoring.
The grammar is described in the sintax.txt file.

FEATURES

- NON destructive workflow: The fractal data are stored in the fractal object itself
- draw 3d fractal
- draw fractal texture (python module PIL required) 
- standard LSYSTEM grammar consistent
- extra grammar features
- it can generate data to use in geometry node 
- it's also provided a sverchok node lite implementation of the engine
- grease pencile compatibility
